# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Logistic Regression & SVM

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **Machine Learning classification techniques** on the famous **Iris dataset** to classify flowers into three species:

* **Setosa**
* **Versicolor**
* **Virginica**

Two models are implemented:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with different kernels (**Linear, Polynomial, RBF**)

The project also visualizes **decision boundaries** to show how the models separate different flower classes.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the classic **Iris dataset**, available in scikit-learn.
**Features used:**

* Sepal length
* Sepal width
* Petal length
* Petal width

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps

1. Load and preprocess the Iris dataset
2. Train and evaluate Logistic Regression model
3. Train and evaluate SVM with different kernels
4. Plot decision boundaries for better visualization
5. Compare model performance

## 📊 Results

* **Logistic Regression** achieved high accuracy on the Iris dataset
* **SVM with RBF kernel** gave the best separation in decision boundaries
* Visualization shows clear class separation for **petal features** compared to **sepal features**
