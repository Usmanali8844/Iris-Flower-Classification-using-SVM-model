**Iris Flower Classification using Logistic Regression & SVM
**Project Overview

This project applies Machine Learning classification techniques on the famous Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Two models are implemented:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernels (Linear, Polynomial, RBF)

The project also visualizes decision boundaries to show how the models separate different flower classes.

**Dataset

The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset, available in scikit-learn.
Features used:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

**Implementation Steps

Load and preprocess the Iris dataset

Train and evaluate Logistic Regression model

Train and evaluate SVM with different kernels

Plot decision boundaries for better visualization

Compare model performance

**Results

Logistic Regression achieved high accuracy on the Iris dataset

SVM with RBF kernel gave the best separation in decision boundaries

Visualization shows clear class separation for petal features compared to sepal features
